1 - for each on Iterator :



2 - Intefaces with method body:
// reference : https://www.journaldev.com/2752/java-8-interface-changes-static-method-default-method

allow only default and static methods with body

advantages :

no need of implementation of those methods in all the derived classes .
for old application it is benefited to not change implemented classes.

Question : what happens if Inteface1 has default method method1 with implementation and Inteface with same default method with implemenation.
?

as java supports multiple inheritance in intefaces. it is the switchvation where we will get Diamond problem. to solve this, java raised the compilation
error to implement that default method in derived classes (backward compatability)

static methods :

not possible to override.

static methods in inteface only available for static default methods.
